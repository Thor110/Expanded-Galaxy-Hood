In order to install the most up-to-date version, you must download the entire repository and then use create-release.bat to pack the relevant files into a zip file and then unpack them, I will move files around and fix it so that this isn't the case soon.

NOTE : This isn't actually working at the moment while I get the repository updated to use the latest version of HoloPatcher.

# Expanded-Galaxy-Hood
Expanded Galaxy : Brotherhood of Shadow : Solomon's Revenge!

Requires the Main & Port parts of the project!

launcher.bat is for choosing which version of the game you wish to play.
